  ABSTRACT={Observation planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is a challenging task as it requires planning trajectories over a large continuous space and with motion models that can not be directly encoded into current planners. Furthermore, realistic problems often require complex objective functions that complicate problem decomposition. In this paper, we propose a local search approach to plan the trajectories of a fleet of UAVs on an observation mission. The strength of the approach lies in its loose coupling with domain specific requirements such as the UAV model or the objective function that are both used as black boxes. Furthermore, the Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) procedure considered facilitates the adaptation of the algorithm to specific requirements through the addition of new neighborhoods. We demonstrate the feasibility and convenience of the method on a large joint observation task in which a fleet of fixed-wing UAVs maps wildfires over areas of a hundred square kilometers. The approach allows generating plans over tens of minutes for a handful of UAVs in matter of seconds, even when considering very short primitive maneuvers.},

  ABSTRACT={The Wildland Fire Remote Sensing (FIRE-RS) project, developed within the European Interreg SUDOE Programme, implements an innovative system for prevention, detection and mapping of natural disasters, centred on wildland fires. This objective is achieved through the synergy of four technologies: forest based infrared land sensors for fire in-situ detection, CubeSat spacecraft for early warnings and communications coverage, UAVs for high-accuracy fire mapping and real time data acquisition, and a situation assessment tool for performing efficient risk assessments and coordination strategies, both during and after the wildland fire emergency. The infrared land sensors are responsible for the early detection and initial analysis of the extension and location of the fire spots. These devices will generate alert messages to be broadcasted to the microsatellite and to the UAVs. The spacecraft (LUME-1) will receive the alert message, and will relay it to the ground facilities, using the on-board SDR communications payload. The Payload Operations Centre is in charge of the live distribution of the alert messages to the Data Distribution and Control Centre, whose main goal is to implement actuation protocols based on the alert messages received from the satellite. It will forward the specific actuation guidelines to the UAVs Control Centres located within the specific emergency zone, where the alert message was originated. The UAVs will fly over the emergency area to perform a more detailed mapping and characterization of the zone. They will use on-board optic payloads, wind sensors and a SDR communication system to gather detailed data. The data will be integrated within a Situation Assessment software suite, providing centralized access to relevant information for the emergency departments to apply decision-making protocols.},

  abstract={Performing a complex autonomous mission with a multi-robot system requires to integrate several deliberative approaches to perform task allocation, optimization, and execution control. Implementing such a deliberative architecture is a complex task: it requires the developer to master the decision algorithms themselves (e.g., automated planning models), to have a good knowledge of the involved robotic platforms, and to think about how these elements will be assembled as a system architecture. We propose a framework to help designing such deliberative architectures. The framework relies on the concept of a hierarchical structure of actors, each actor managing goals with specific planning or optimization approaches, and delegating sub-goals to other actors.},

  ABSTRACT={Wildfires, also known as forest or wildland fires, are uncontrolled vegetation fires occurring in rural areas that cause tremendous damage to the society, harming environment, property and people. The firefighting endeavor is a dull, dirty and dangerous job and as such, can greatly benefit from automation to reduce human exposure to hazards. Aerial remote sensing is a common technique to obtain precise information about a wildfire state so fire response teams can prepare countermeasures. This task, when performed with manned aerial vehicles, expose operators to high risks that can be eliminated by the use of autonomous vehicles. This thesis introduces a wildfire monitoring system based on fleets of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide firefighters with timely updated information about a wildland fire. We present an approach to plan trajectories for a fleet of fixed-wing UAVs to observe a wildfire evolving over time. Realistic models of the terrain, of the fire propagation process, and of the UAVs are exploited, together with a model of the wind, to predict wildfire spread and plan UAV motion. The approach tailors a generic Variable Neighborhood Search method to these models and the associated constraints. The execution of the planned monitoring mission provides wildfire maps that are transmitted to the fire response team and exploited by the planning algorithm to plan new observation trajectories. Algorithms and models are integrated within a software architecture allowing for execution under scenarios with different levels of realism, with real and simulated UAVs flying over a real or synthetic wildfire. Mixed-reality simulation results show the ability to plan observation trajectories for a small fleet of UAVs, and to update the plans when new information on the fire are incorporated in the fire model.},

  abstract={Real world applications of planning, like in industry and robotics, require modelling rich and diverse scenarios. Their resolution usually requires coordinated and concurrent action executions. In several cases, such planning problems are naturally decomposed in a hierarchical way and expressed by a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) formalism. The PDDL language used to specify planning domains has evolved to cover the different planning paradigms. However, formulating real and complex scenarios where numerical and temporal constraints concur in defining a solution is still a challenge. Our proposition aims at filling the gap between existing planning languages and operational needs. To do so, we propose to extend HDDL taking inspiration from PDDL 2.1 and ANML to express temporal and numerical expressions. This paper opens discussions on the semantics and the syntax needed to extend HDDL, and illustrate these needs with the modelling of an Earth Observing Satellite planning problem.},
