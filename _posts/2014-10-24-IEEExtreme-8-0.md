IEEExtreme is a global competition in which IEEE student members have 24 hours to try to program the solution to a set of problems. Eighth edition of this contest was held the 18th October 2014 from 00:00 to 23:59 UTC+0 (+2 hours in Spain). 1750 teams from 60+ countries entered the competition.

For the first time, University of Granada students participated on IEEExtreme. Three teams were formed: Nazaries, HerederosDeTuring and MineCoders (my team). 9 people in total. My team-mates were Benito Palacios ([@pleonex](https://twitter.com/pleonex)) and Nico Guerrero ([@nitehack](https://twitter.com/nitehack)).

We started competition at 02:00 UTC+2 and lasted, without having any rest, until 02:00 next day. Impressively, we managed to solve successfully 11 of the 23 problems proposed. This work got 1125.78 points and we ranked 307th position on global leaderboard and 3rd position on the spanish one. Source code of problem solutions are available at [student branch IEEExtreme 8.0 github repository](https://github.com/ieeeugrsb/ieeextreme8).

And finally, just for fun, a timelapse of the 24-hour competition!
